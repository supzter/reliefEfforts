                <p>We have been developing a suite of tools that are used by Aquafeed manufacturers to track their feed ingredients, formulate feed, and price them according to their nutritional value. This design document will cover one of these tools: The Feed Formulation Tool.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The Feed Formulation Tool (FFT) is designed to generate least-cost feed formulations for over 30 species, find production volume estimates for 15 countries leading in aquaculture, and to run market sizing analysis to compare your feed ingredient against other ingredients in generating a typical feed formulation.</p>
